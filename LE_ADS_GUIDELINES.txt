For your data science project (Learning Evidence), I strongly recommend using Shiny for Python as your main framework for developing interactive dashboards and web applications. Shiny allows you to build and share dynamic data-driven apps directly from Python, making it an excellent choice for communicating analytical results, visualizations, and machine learning predictions in an interactive way. You can also use Shiny for R if you're more confortable with R.

In addition to Shiny, you may also explore the following alternative tools for data app development and model deployment for Python:

Interactive Data App Frameworks:

Streamlit – ideal for quickly building and deploying interactive data science dashboards with simple syntax.

Dash (by Plotly) – great for creating highly customizable analytical apps and visualizations.

Panel – integrates multiple visualization libraries such as Bokeh, Plotly, and Matplotlib into cohesive dashboards.

Gradio – useful for deploying machine learning models with user-friendly web interfaces.

General-Purpose Python Web Frameworks (for more advanced deployment):

Flask – a lightweight and flexible micro web framework suitable for deploying APIs or integrating ML models into web applications.

Django – a full-featured web framework for building scalable, database-driven applications with authentication, routing, and admin panels.

FastAPI – a modern, high-performance framework for building APIs and serving machine learning models efficiently.

Your choice of framework will depend on the complexity of your project, the intended audience, and your comfort level with web technologies. Shiny remains a highly accessible and powerful starting point, but exploring alternatives will help you broaden your understanding of how data science integrates into real-world applications.


Instructions

This learning evidence serves as the culminating output for your Applied Data Science course.

Students will demonstrate mastery of the data science life cycle by designing, implementing, and communicating a complete data-driven solution to a real-world problem.

The final output should be:

Live or tangible (e.g., a deployed web dashboard, Streamlit/Shiny app).

Demonstrate the full data science cycle — including problem definition, data collection, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and communication.

Your app or dashboard must:

Display interactive visualizations of your dataset

Include summary statistics or KPIs

Show model results or insights

Contain a short descriptive narrative (context, findings, and recommendations)

Here are some suggested topics:

Education: Predict student performance or engagement in Moodle

Business: Forecast monthly sales based on customer behavior

Environment: Analyze local air quality and temperature trends

Health: Predict the likelihood of heart disease from patient data

Transportation: Cluster traffic accident hotspots using geospatial data

Sample Project Flow

Example (Python + Streamlit):

Problem: Predict student dropout risk

Data: Moodle course logs (logins, quiz attempts, forum posts)

Cleaning: Use Polars to handle missing or incorrect entries

EDA: Plotnine to visualize engagement vs. grades
x
Modeling: Random Forest for prediction, K-Means for engagement clusters

Evaluation: Accuracy = 0.84, Silhouette = 0.63

Deployment: Streamlit app with interactive inputs for teachers

Communication: App hosted on Streamlit Cloud with clear insights

Submission Guidelines

Deadline: 19 December 2025

Format: URL or Actual Demo (recorded video link) and short descriptive narrative (via UVE)

Group Size: 1–3 members

Grading: Refer to the LE rubric in the syllabus
